# JDBC
I create a project where you can execute querries in java throught JDBCExecutor class.The tables are Customer and Order who are in a relationship.I implemented them using DAO pattern.I create an interface DataAccesObject where i defined methods, then i implemented them in CustomerDAO for Customer table and then OrderDao for Order table.I defined their atributes in Order and Customer class.
